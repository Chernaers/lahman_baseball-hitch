--ANSWER: David Price is the Vanderbilt player who has earned the most money in the majors, at $245,553,888.00
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--NOTE: When the Tigers fell out of the postseason race in 2015, they traded him to the Blue Jays, who won their division and advanced to the ALCS. That following off-season, the Red Sox signed Price to a franchise-record seven-year, $217 million contract. At the time, it was the largest contract total for a pitcher in Major League history. 

--Price was drafted with the first-overall pick of the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft. He signed his first professional contract on August 15, 2007. The six-year contract was worth $11.25 million ($8.5 million guaranteed), including a $5.6 million signing bonus. After the contract was approved by the MLB, he was added to the Devil Rays 40-man roster before being optioned to the minor leagues to begin his career.[7]  The total value of Price's bonus was the largest in draft history. The signing bonus was second-largest in draft history.
